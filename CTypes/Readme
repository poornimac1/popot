In order to use a C++ function as an input to the CMA-ES python library
of Hansen, you first need to define your problem like in Pb.cc

And then compile a shared library :
:> gcc -shared -O3 -o Pb.so Pb.cc

You can then test calling your function with : 

:> python test_function_evaluation.py

And use it into CMA-ES with :

:> python test.py
